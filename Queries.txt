// ----------------FOREIGN KEY----FOREIGN KEY-----FOREIGN KEY----------------------------------------------------------------

## how to connect foreign key.
# first of all create new table for customers.

1. create table customers (cid int not null auto_increment primary key, cname varchar(55), email varchar(100) );

# create another table for foreign key(for matching)
2. create table orders (oid int not null auto_increment primary key, orderdate date, cid int, foreign key(cid) references customers(cid) );

#insert data in customers table.
3. insert into customers (cid,cname,email) values (1,'vinod', 'vinod@thapa.com'),(2, 'Aadarsh', 'aadasrh@.com');

# insert data in orders table;;;
4. insert into orders(oid, orderdate, amount, cid) values (1, '2019/05/05',55,1), (2,'2019/08/06', 85, 2), (3, '2019/08/05', 155, 1), (4, '2019/05/12', 95, 3);

# now
5. select * from customers;

### now it's time to connect 2 tables data's...
6. select * from customers, orders where customers.cid = orders.cid;
OR OR OR ORO OR OR ORO OR OR OR OR OR OR OR 

7. mysql> select * from customers
    -> join orders
    -> on customers.cid = orders.cid;

8. mysql> select cname, orderdate, amount from customers
    -> join orders
    -> on customers.cid = orders.cid;               ==>> only when we know that amount of a person...

## inner join
mysql> select cname, orderdate, amount, customers.cid from customers
    -> join orders
    -> on customers.cid = orders.cid;             ==>> by this we also know the id of the customers...

## left join   ==>> it will show the common data of both tables and also show all the data's first table
 9. mysql> select * from customers left join orders

## right join   ==>> opposite of LEFT JOIN
10. select * from customers right join orders on customers.cid = orders.cid;
